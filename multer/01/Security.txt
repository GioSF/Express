If you are talking about file uploads to a server use various methods to check the filetype. The overhead is tiny. Magic numbers give you a more robust way to verify the filetype but can still be spoofed.

Never rely on file extension, this is the most trivial part to spoof.

If it were me, regardless of the risk to the system I would always:

    verify file extension (the final extension and anything after a .) after sanitising the entire name
    verify file size (within defined range)
    Verify mime type
    check magic numbers

All the above checks use a whitelist for verification.

I would also make sure the uploaded file gets moved to a secure directory (without exec permissions) and gets assigned a random filename.
